## Features

- **Fork of [Pufferfish](https://github.com/pufferfish-gg/Pufferfish)** for the best performance.
- **Contains [Lithium](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/lithium-fabric) patches** which respect Vanilla parity.
- **Efficient redstone** relying on [Alternate Current](https://github.com/SpaceWalkerRS/alternate-current), up to 4 times faster than Paper's algorithm.
- **(WIP) Implements [C2ME](https://github.com/RelativityMC/C2ME-fabric)** to improve chunk generation speed, I/O and loading.
- **Reduced bandwidth consumption and CPU usage** from avoiding sending useless packets in certain situations.
- **Pre-tweaked** configuration files to reach optimal performance with minimal impact on normal behaviors.
- **Login location** hiding feature, which adds another security layer in the logs for admins.
- **Toggleable metrics**, no one can collect data, not even us.
- **Bugfixes** for several Minecraft issues.
- **Faster process** for Vanilla methods.
- **Plugin compatibility** with Spigot & Paper plugins.
